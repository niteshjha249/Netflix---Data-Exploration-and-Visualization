# 📊 Netflix Data Exploration and Visualisation

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to uncover trends in content distribution, genre popularity, movie durations, and regional availability. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**,  we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to generate meaningful insights and provide data-driven recommendations.

## 📂 Dataset Information  
- **Source:** [Netflix Dataset](#)  
- **Features:**
  - `title`: Name of the content  
  - `type`: Movie or TV Show  
  - `director`: Director(s) of the content  
  - `cast`: Actors featured  
  - `country`: Country of production  
  - `date_added`: When it was added to Netflix  
  - `release_year`: Year of release  
  - `rating`: Content rating (e.g., TV-MA, PG-13)  
  - `duration`: Length of movies (in minutes) or TV show seasons  
  - `listed_in`: Genre classification  

## 📌 Key Analyses & Insights  
✔ **Content Distribution:** How movies & TV shows are spread across different countries  
✔ **Genre Popularity:** Most common genres on Netflix  
✔ **Movie Durations:** Understanding how long Netflix movies typically are  
✔ **Rating Analysis:** Finding the most common content ratings  
✔ **Trends Over Time:** Analyzing how content additions have changed over the years  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Processing:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning  
- **Visualization:** Bar charts, Histograms, Line plots  

## 📸 Visualizations  
📊 **Top 10 Countries with Most Netflix Content**  
- The United States has the highest number of titles.  
- India and the UK follow in second and third place.  

📊 **Trend of Movies vs. TV Shows Over the Years**  
- Movies dominated Netflix’s content initially but started declining after 2019.  
- TV shows have been growing steadily but never surpassed movies.  
- Both categories saw a decline in additions after 2020, likely due to content saturation and strategy shifts.
